Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Include a hyperlink here to your github repository for class.
